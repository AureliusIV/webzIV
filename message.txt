# Dear Gelai,
Christmas is brighter when shared with the one you love. While my physical presence may not be with you right now, the fact that we share the same sky which holds the stars and the air which God has so generously given us is  enough for me to appreciate and fully acknowledge, that your heart is indeed close to mine.
 Below is a poem I dedicate to you, which I hope will brighten up your Christmas. 

"a present that can't be wrapped"

Christmas has come, and presents will be shown
Yet a quiet and warm gift remains unwrapped.
The spirit insists it be dressed, for in your heart it is throned.
Yet doubt remains, how can air ever be lapped?

So naive, the spirit thought.
This gift can be wrapped, but not in your way.
So do not be distraught.
It is surely not tangible, but it does not dismay.

First, you open your hands in the cold night,
And let them be gentle, not eager to claim.
You wrap it in patience, steady and tight,
And bind it with trust, not fear or shame.

Then you place it in moments both silent and true,
Where time slows down and nothing is rushed.
Where eyes meet with a warm hue,
Then cover it softly with all that you do,
With charity freely given, not borrowed nor crushed.

So when Christmas has passed and the ribbons are gone,
This present remains, never withdrawn.

A present that cannot be wrapped, 
For it is within your heart, mapped.

Love.

Most sincerely,
Ivan
