# Dear Andrea,
This is a poem for you, titled " oltre il velo di stelle"

Beyond the veil of stars, lies the glory of love,
Seraphic choirs singing in eternal joy—
Joy, reminiscent of an ethereal white dove,
One which soars through the heavens above.

Just a glimpse beyond, I beg!
The desire to witness lies ahead!
Flowers bloom in solemn glow;
the ebullient grass nurturing below.

A realm in which I am no longer a toy,
Where thorns no longer wound my tread,
And love rests within its warm shell.

I wish to see—
What the beholder veils,
In which I am certain;
That love never fails.



Most sincerely,
Ivan
